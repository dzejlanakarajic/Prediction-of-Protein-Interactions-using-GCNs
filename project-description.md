# Predicting of Protein Interactions using GCNs

Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are essential to almost every process in a cell. Exploring PPIs is
crucial for understanding cell physiology in normal and disease states. The knowledge of PPIs can be
used for drug development and to assign roles (i.e., protein functions) to uncharacterized proteins. In
this project, we investigate the utility of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) [9] for the problem
of predicting protein-protein interactions (PPIs). The totality of PPIs is presented in the form of an
undirected network, we thus formulate the problem as a link prediction task by GCN. Your task is
to implement GCN for link prediction in PyTorch. The following steps should be undertaken and
documented:

1. Problem Definition:
  *Introduction to GCNs [9]
  *A short review on state-of-the-art for PPIs [10â€“12]
  *Formal definition of the problem (with mathematical notations)
  
2. Data Prepossessing
